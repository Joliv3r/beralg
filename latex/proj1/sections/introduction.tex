\section{Introduction}

Unfortunately for the reader of this project, in addition to being the mandatory project in this course, I did take the opportunity to have this as a learning experience with Rust. There will probably be both bad code, and questionable decisions in some implementations. There are also way more overhead than necessary, all this mainly as a Rust learning experience.

When looking through the code in the appendix, I will encourage you to mainly just focus on the file \lstinline{src/integer_compuatations.rs} found in Appendix \ref{sec:integer-computations}.
Here lies all the relevant code for implementations as requested by the project description.
The tests and code for plotting can be found in \lstinline{src/tests.rs}, in Appendix \ref{sec:tests}.
Most of the other code is for personal learning and is included as it is still necessary for the project to compile.
