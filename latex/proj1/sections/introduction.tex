\section{Introduction}

% Consider the Galois field $\mathbb{F}_p = \operatorname{GF}(p)$ for $p$ a prime. We will look at the multiplicative group $\mathbb{F}_p^*$ and implement some arithmetic including exponentiation, and then do a quick analysis of the runtime of a naive implementation of exponentiation and the square and multiply approach.

Unfortunately for the reader of this project, in addition to being the mandatory project in this course, I did take the opportunity to have this as a learning experience with Rust. There will probably be both bad code, and questionable decisions in some implementations. There are also way more overhead than necessary, all this mainly as a Rust learning experience.
