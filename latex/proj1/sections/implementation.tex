\section{Implementations of modular arithmetic}

As we will deal with large integers, specifically larger than $2^{128}-1$, we will use the crate \href{https://docs.rs/rug/latest/rug/}{rug} for the integer implementation.
We will work in the multiplicative group $\mathbb{F}_p^*$, so division is well defined and must then be implemented.
Now we will define division as multiplication by the inverse, that is 

\begin{equation}
  a / b = ab^{-1}, \quad a, b \in \mathbb{F}_p^*.
  \label{eq:division}
\end{equation}

To find the inverse, we will use the Extended Euclidean algorithm as found in the appendix \ref{sec:ext-euclid-alg}.
Now to do division, we will just do the Extended Euclidean algorithm, which takes $(a, b)$ and gives us $(d, x, y)$ such that

\begin{equation}
  ax + by = d
  \label{eq:ext-euclid-alg}
\end{equation}

and by using $b = p$ we get $ax + bp = 1$. Thus

\begin{equation}
  ax \equiv 1 \pmod{p}.
\end{equation}

So in short we have inversion:
