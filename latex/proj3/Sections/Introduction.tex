\section{Introduction}

  We will in this project take a look at some lattice algorithms.
  This project took a lot of time, mainly because of mistakes while programming.
  Because of this there were some unforeseen time constraints, which I of course could have done better to avoid.
  Therefore I will not focus on the theory as much as the implementation and results.
  Mostly I will only give some vague directions and state the important results that make algorithms work.
  
  When it comes to the actual source code, I have taken time to rewrite the crate to a library crate, and I will therefore only include the relevant files as this should be enough to compile.
  I will use the crate \mintinline{bash}{ndarray} and \mintinline{bash}{ndarray-linalg} for implementations of arrays with vector like operations.
