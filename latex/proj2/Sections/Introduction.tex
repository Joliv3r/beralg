\section{Introduction}

  We will in this project look at prime number generation, which is fairly different from the last project.
  I will still write this code in the same crate as the exponentiation, mainly because there is some code that is reused in both these projects. 
  For further development I will probably consider doing some cleaning of the file structure, however I have not yet come around to do so.
  One should therefore mainly look at the files \mintinline{sh}{src/prime.rs} and \mintinline{sh}{src/prime_statistics.rs} as these are mainly the only updates since last project.
  Finally as commented on last time, I have concluded that I probably forgot the recursive flag for zipping the code last time, so I will be aware of this in the future and most importantly right now.
